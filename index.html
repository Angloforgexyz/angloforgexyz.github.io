-<h1>AngloForge</h1>

<div class="tagline">
English is not memorized.<br>
It is trained.
</div>

<p>
AngloForge builds the physical foundations of speech:<br>
breath control, sound precision, and hesitation removal.
</p>

<p>
This is not a course for passive learners.<br>
It is a performance lab for those willing to train deliberately.
